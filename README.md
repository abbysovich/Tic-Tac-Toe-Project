# Tic-Tac-Toe-Project

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Artificial Intelligence project!!! The computer will play against you in a one-on-one tic-tac-toe battle.

##Instructions
To start the game, go to the class named "Main.java" and run it. When you run this class, the game will automatically start.

Moves are of the form (row number),(column number). For instance, if you want to play in the center, you'd play '2,2'. If you want to play in the square directly above the center, you'd enter '3,2'.

To replay the game, just exit the current run cycle and start a new one by rerunning the Main class.

Most importantly, Enjoy!!!
